# Automobile Data - Principal Component Analysis
In this project, I aim to generate and visualize the PCA for the auto-mpg dataset and extract insights.

# Dataset:
There are 8 variables in the data:

mpg: miles per gallon <br>
cyl: number of cylinders <br>
disp: engine displacement (cu. inches) or engine size <br>
hp: horsepower <br>
wt: vehicle weight (lbs.) <br>
acc: time taken to accelerate from O to 60 mph (sec.) <br>
yr: model year <br>
car name: car model name <br>
